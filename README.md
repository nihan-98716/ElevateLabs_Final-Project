### 🔗 [Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nv_IwsM1YZtmyT7oFKG-iRdxzK2dspSz?usp=sharing)

### 📘 Overview
The **Plant Disease Classification System** is a deep learning-based application that identifies and classifies plant leaf diseases from images.  
It helps farmers and researchers detect diseases early and recommend corrective measures, improving agricultural yield and efficiency.

### ⚙️ Features
- Image-based disease detection using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**  
- Supports multiple plant types and disease categories  
- Real-time image preprocessing and augmentation  
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix visualization  
- Deployed via Colab for easy execution and testing  

### 🧠 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **OpenCV**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**
- **NumPy & Pandas**

### 📊 Workflow
1. **Dataset Loading & Preprocessing**
   - Import dataset from Kaggle or local source
   - Image resizing and normalization  
2. **Model Building**
   - CNN architecture with ReLU activation and Dropout layers  
3. **Model Training**
   - Trained on augmented dataset using Adam optimizer  
4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Tested on unseen images and validated using metrics  
5. **Prediction**
   - Predicts the disease class from new plant leaf images

## 🎬 2. Movie Recommendation System

### 🔗 [Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Qpo8sfAmjpXMkY4ZgDmZVJIXJ1DVNVb2?usp=sharing)

### 📘 Overview
The **Movie Recommendation System** is a content-based recommender engine that suggests movies to users based on similarity metrics such as genre, keywords, cast, and overview.  
It provides a personalized movie experience by leveraging **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **cosine similarity**.

### ⚙️ Features
- Recommends top 5–10 similar movies for any given title  
- Uses **cosine similarity** and **TF-IDF vectorization**  
- Clean and interactive workflow in Colab  
- Easy to integrate into web or mobile frontends  
- Dataset preprocessing, feature extraction, and similarity computation  

### 🧠 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Pandas & NumPy**
- **NLTK / TextBlob**
- **Matplotlib**

### 📊 Workflow
1. **Dataset Loading**
   - Uses movie metadata dataset from TMDB or Kaggle  
2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removes null entries, combines features into a unified column  
3. **Feature Extraction**
   - TF-IDF or Count Vectorization for textual attributes  
4. **Similarity Computation**
   - Cosine similarity between movie feature vectors  
5. **Recommendation**
   - Retrieve and display top similar movies for user input

## 🧩 Future Improvements
- 🌐 Deploy as a **web app** using Flask or Streamlit  
- 🤖 Enhance models with **transfer learning** (ResNet / EfficientNet for plant disease)  
- 🎞️ Add **hybrid recommendation system** (collaborative + content-based)  
- ☁️ Integrate **cloud storage** for larger datasets
